        "1. YOGA - COVID-19 brought with it nearly two years of increased isolation and social distancing. In-person yoga became difficult, sometimes impossible to schedule. Yoga, however, creates synergy even when practicing virtually, with friends, strangers or a solo instructor.The best way to learn yoga is with a qualified teacher, either in a private sessi some poses easier. You can even do yoga in a chair instead of on the floor",
        "2. CYCLING - Exercise like cycling can lower the levels of your body’s stress hormone, cortisol. Getting on your bike can relieve tension in your body too. Research shows that those who regularly cycle have a significantly lower risk of feeling stressed and cycling can be much cheaper in the long-run than a gym membership, saving you some cash and helping to ease stress over your finances.",
        "3. RUNNING - There is some evidence that engaging in exercise such as running may help alleviate symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders. The 2020 review noted that longer-term running interventions (of up to 20 weeks) were associated with improvements in a range of mental health outcomes. Runners often experienced lower levels of depression and anxiety and greater psychological well-being than non-runners.",
        "4. SWIMMING - Swimming is also a very effective and natural way to improve our mental health. It keeps our body calm and composed.Researchers have found that swimming promotes both physical and mental well-being; this isn’t news to anyone who regularly frequents the pool deck. But there are additional benefits that you may not be aware of that extend beyond the obvious. The increased blood flow strengthens the heart.",
        "5. GOOD DIET - From a young age, we’re taught that eating well helps us look and feel our physical best. What we’re not always told is that good nutrition significantly affects our mental health, too. A healthy, well-balanced diet can help us think clearly and feel more alert. It can also improve concentration and attention span. Conversely, an inadequate diet can lead to fatigue, impaired decision-making, and can slow down reaction time. In fact, a poor diet can actually aggravate, and may even lead to, stress and depression."
